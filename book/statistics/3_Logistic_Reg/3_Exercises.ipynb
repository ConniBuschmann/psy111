    "For today's exercise we will use the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)**. It is a collection of data used for predicting whether a breast tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous), containinh information derived from images of breast mass samples obtained through fine needle aspirates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of 569 samples with 30 features that measure various characteristics of cell nuclei, such as radius, texture, perimeter, and area. Each sample is labeled as either **malignant (1)** or **benign (0)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To import the dataset in Python, you can run the following code chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Please [visit the documentation](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic) and familiarize yourself with the dataset.\n",
    "2. Find the instructions for importing the data in Python. You can remove the printing of the metadata as this looks horrible in the notebook. Read it in the documentation instead.\n",
    "3. Convert the outcome into a 1D vector by using `y = np.ravel(y)`. This is the required input for by the logistic regression model in the next exercise.\n",
    "4. Take an initial look at the features (predictors) and targets (outcomes) through the `.head()` method."
