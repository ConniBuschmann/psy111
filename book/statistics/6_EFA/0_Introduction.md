# Exploratory Factor Analysis

Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) is used to identify a (generally) small number of factors that explain most of the variance observed in a larger number of manifest variables. Therefore, EFA is a *dimensionality reduction* method. It helps in understanding the relationships between variables by identifying clusters of variables that are highly correlated with each other but less so with variables in other clusters.
