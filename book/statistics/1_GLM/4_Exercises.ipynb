    "1. Loading the data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the `diabetes` dataset through the `sklearn` library \n",
    "- Use the `DESCR` attribute of the data set to get its description. Understand the variables, their meanings, and how they relate to the medical context (e.g., what each feature like BMI, age, and blood pressure represents in the context of diabetes).\n",

    "*Hint: If you're using a Jupyter Notebook, make sure to select any of \"View as a scrollable element or open in a text editor\" at the bottom of the output to see the entire description.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Preparing the data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Look at the documentation of the `load_diabetes()` function to see which outpt it returns\n",
    "- Create an observation matrix `X` containing the data and a target vector `y` containing the target (diabetes progression)\n",
    "- Create a unified DataFrame combining X and y. Rename the `target` (y) column to `diabetes`\n",
    "- Compute the correlation matrix for all columns in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Visualizing the data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plot the correlation matrix by using `seaborn`'s `heatmap()` function. The plot should have the following featurees:\n",
    "    - The cells in the plot should be annotated with the correlation values\n",
    "    - The colormap should be `\"coolwarm\"` (it's a good choice for correlation values)\n",
    "    - The colorbar should range from `-1` to `1` (because this is the full range correlation values can take)\n",
    "    - The cells in the plot should be quare (just because it looks nice)\n",
    "    - The cells should be separated with lines of width `1` (also because it looks nice)\n",
    "-  Identify the variable that shows the highest correlation (positive or negative) with the target variable (diabetes progression)"

    "Age could be influencing both BMI and diabetes progression. As people age, both their BMI and risk for diabetes may increase, potentially inflating the observed correlation between BMI and diabetes progression. By holding age constant, we can test whether the relationship between BMI and diabetes progression persists independently of age.\n",

This can be useful as an exploratory step, but brings many potential issues such as potentially high multicollinearity or the risk of overfitting. These topics will be covered later in the year."
