# Path Modelling

Today, we will implement path modeling in Python using the `semopy` package. We will start by formulating hypotheses about causal relationships between variables. These hypotheses will help us estimate a system of directed effects, based on an observed correlation matrix of multiple variables.

The `semopy` package is quite powerful, and we will also use it in the upcoming sessions on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA).
